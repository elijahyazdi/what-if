## Project Overview

**What Could You Do?** (also referred to as **What If?**) is an ethical decision-making mobile app designed for parents, educators, and therapists to facilitate meaningful conversations with children and teens.

The app presents age-appropriate "What if..." scenarios that encourage critical thinking and ethical reasoning through open-ended discussions rather than seeking predetermined "correct" answers.

**Core Question Format:**
```
"What if [scenario]?"
followed by: "What are all the things you can think of that you could do?"
```

This phrasing is intentional. It encourages brainstorming over judgment, creative thinking over compliance, and genuine expression over one-word answers. The goal is not to teach children what to think, but to help them practice *how* to think through complex situations.

**Mission:** Every child deserves an adult who asks great questions and truly listens to the answers. We're building tools to make that easier.

## Design System

### Typography
- **Barrio** (Google Fonts, cursive) — Major headings only, all caps, attention-grabbing
- **Road Rage** (Google Fonts, cursive) — All body text, buttons, labels, descriptions, navigation
- This pairing creates a bold, street-art / graffiti aesthetic with strong visual personality

## App Architecture & Features

### Current Prototype (React Web)
The current wireframe prototype is built in React with these screens and features:

**Screens:**
1. **Welcome** — Splash with "What Could You Do?" branding, gradient background (indigo-50 → purple-50 → pink-50), large background "?" watermark
2. **How to Use** — 3-step onboarding guide for meaningful conversations
3. **Home** — Age group selection grid (4 colored buttons), "Ready to explore?" prompt, resume last session
4. **Age Selection** — Grid view of all age groups with prompt counts
5. **Prompt Display** — Full-screen prompt text, Read Aloud (TTS), Save/Favorite, prompt counter (X of Y), Discussion Tips, Next Prompt navigation
6. **Community** — Browse/share prompts, filter tabs (All, Favorites, My Submissions), user cards with roles
7. **Profile** — Activity stats, recent conversations, milestones, favorite prompts, quality/safety settings
8. **Settings** — Account, preferences, content filters, support info
9. **Submit Prompt** — User-generated prompt submission form

**Implemented Features:**
- Favorites system with local storage persistence
- Text-to-speech accessibility (browser Speech Synthesis API)
- User prompt submission form (ready for backend integration)
- Community sharing with quality control settings (3 filter levels: all content, vetted content, friends-only)
- Comprehensive onboarding flow
- Activity tracking in profile
- Bottom tab navigation (Home, Community, Profile, Settings)

### Recommended Production Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React Native + Expo |
| UI Components | React Native Paper or NativeBase |
| Navigation | React Navigation |
| Backend | Firebase or Supabase |
| Database | Firestore or PostgreSQL |
| Auth | Firebase Auth or Auth0 |
| Hosting | Vercel (web) + App Stores |

Cross-platform (React Native) was chosen because:
- Target users (parents, educators, therapists) use both iOS and Android roughly equally
- App is UI/content-focused — no heavy graphics or device-specific features
- React prototype can inform React Native development directly
- Educators often use school-provided Android devices
- Professional tier needs to reach institutions on either platform

## Design Principles

1. **Dialogue facilitation over gamification** — No scoring, no voting, no "right answers." Focus on the thinking process.
2. **Mobile-first, distraction-free** — Clean interface that keeps the conversation front and center.
3. **Age-appropriate content first** — Content safety takes precedence over complexity.
4. **Brainstorming over judgment** — The phrasing "What are all the things you can think of..." is deliberate.
5. **Accessibility** — TTS support, large readable fonts, intuitive navigation.
6. **Privacy by design** — No PII stored, no HIPAA burden, anonymous organization for professional use.
7. **Scalable foundation** — Architecture supports future backend, community features, and professional tier expansion.

## Development Guidelines

### When Building UI
- Always use Barrio for headings (uppercase) and Road Rage for everything else
- Use the 5-color palette via inline styles (not Tailwind arbitrary values — they don't compile in all contexts)
- Age group buttons must show their distinct assigned colors
- Deep purple (`#49297e`) for borders and structural elements
- Hot pink (`#e10086`) for primary CTAs and active states
- Welcome screen uses soft gradient background (indigo-50 → purple-50 → pink-50), NOT the full color palette gradient

### When Working with Prompts
- Every prompt follows the format: "What if [scenario]? What are all the things you can think of that you could do?"
- Prompts are categorized by age group AND category AND subcategory AND tier
- Free tier prompts should be safe and positive; Premium adds real-world complexity; Professional addresses sensitive/therapeutic topics
- Subcategories are granular topic tags (228 unique values) — use them for filtering

### When Building Features
- No localStorage in Claude.ai artifacts (use React state or in-memory storage)
- Favorites and user data should persist via backend when available, fall back to device storage
- Community features need quality control filtering (all / vetted / friends-only)
- Professional features must maintain anonymous organization (no student names ever)
- TTS uses browser Speech Synthesis API

### Code Style
- React functional components with hooks
- Single-file components preferred for prototyping
- Tailwind CSS for utility styling (use core classes only, not arbitrary values)
- Inline styles for custom colors from the palette
- lucide-react for icons
