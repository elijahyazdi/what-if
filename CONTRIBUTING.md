## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/castrovibes/what-if.git
   cd what-if
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Follow **React hooks** best practices
- Use **functional components** (no class components)
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Adding New Prompts

To add prompts for age groups, edit the `prompts` object in `WireframeApp.tsx`:

```typescript
const prompts: { [key: string]: string[] } = {
  '3-5': [
    "Your new prompt here...",
  ],
  // ... other age groups
};
```

### Prompt Guidelines

- Keep language age-appropriate
- Focus on everyday scenarios
- Encourage problem-solving
- Avoid violence or scary content
- Test with target age group when possible

## Project Conventions

### File Organization
- Keep all screens in `WireframeApp.tsx` for now
- Extract reusable components if needed
- Place assets in `assets/` directory

### State Management
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- AsyncStorage for persistent data
- Keep state close to where it's used

### Styling
- Use StyleSheet.create() for styles
- Follow existing color palette
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on different screen sizes
